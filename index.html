            Each building tells a story of material: what was used, where it came from, and what it displaced. Yet the scale of these materials is rarely visible to the public eye.
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            So how do we begin to see the materials that make our homes, neighborhoods, and cities?
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            While conducting field research for my undergraduate thesis in architecture in 2019, I turned my attention to the aging theater complexes of Taichung, Taiwan’s Central District — once the city’s bustling entertainment hub. Most of these buildings, constructed in the 1950s and ’60s, fell into disuse or were demolished by the early 2000s, casualties of shifting consumer habits, the rise of modern shopping malls, and the lingering impact of the <a href="https://www.twreporter.org/a/sars-memories-life-under-quarantine-in-heping-hospital-english">SARS outbreak</a> that struck Taiwan in 2003.
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            I ended up talking my way in an abandoned theater by playing my student card with the security guard to get 30 minuts inside. I wandered the whole building, floor by floor, from the basement to the rooftop.
        </div>

        <div class="g-text">
            It felt like I was slipping through layers of forgotten slices of life. The furniture was looted or trashed, fixtures torn out, and what remained were surfaces: dust, tiles, textures, the bare bones of the hustle that once was. These were building materials that couldn't be salvaged.

        <div class="g-text">
            Now that the building has been demolished, taken apart and hauled away (in 2020, just one year after I graduated,) I feel an urge to tell a story. One about the identity of a city and how it’s shaped by its parts — its buildings. People come and go, interiors shift, and memories change, but the materials that linger hold a kind of silent presence. That deserves to be celebrated, and I knew, someday I'd have the opportunity to do so.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="g-block">   
        <div class="g-text">
            Six years later, I’m in New York City. A metropolis shaped as much by construction as by demolition. And here, the question of how we celebrate building materials feels as expansive as the skyline itself.
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            Thanks to the work of many talented individuals and civic teams, the city now boasts a growing number of public-facing tools: from city-led efforts like the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/html/dob-development-report.html">NYC Construction Dashboard</a> to independent projects like <a href="https://sidewalkwidths.nyc/#13/40.714/-74.005">Sidewalk Widths NYC</a> by <a href="https://meliharvey.com/">Meli Harvey</a> . That momentum got me thinking: perhaps I could build a visualization of my own while I’m here.
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            Over the past two semesters of graduate study, I’ve been doing just that — leveraging open data and machine learning to estimate and visualize the building materials that make up New York City:<br><br>

            NYC Building Materials is a platform designed to offer a new way to explore the city through a material lens: a living, interactive map that visualizes the footprints of what we build and what we erase. By layering data, design, and curiosity, this project invites us to reintroduce ourselves to the built environment.
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            As of 2025, NYC Building Materials has collected and estimated the building materials of over 800,000 buildings in New York City.
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            The map is coded in five colors, each representing a major category of building material: blue for timber, green for glass, yellow for concrete, red for masonry, and purple for steel.
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            Each dot corresponds to a 100-by-100-meter (328-by-328-foot) hexagonal area, illustrating the dominant material used within that zone. When layered together, the colors begin to reveal patterns; subtle shifts in construction logic and material preference that, when viewed alongside other datasets, shed light on the forces shaping New York City's physical fabric. The result is a portrait of the city’s built environment that’s typically hidden in plain sight.

            Here's one of the patterns that got my attention immediately after rendering out the map:

                    Straddling the border of Queens and Brooklyn are neighborhoods like Maspeth, Blissville, and East Williamsburg; areas often overlooked in media and their urban fabric less defined than their neighbors.

                    Filter out buildings taller than two stories, and the pattern sharpens. The crater reveals itself as a dense concentration of low-rise masonry and concrete structures.

                    Exclude postwar buildings instead, and another insight comes into focus. Compared to much of New York City, this “crater” is not just an outlier in form, but in age: its buildings are, in fact, actually newer than those in many surrounding neighborhoods.

            New York City is, by any measure, an old city. More than 70 percent of its buildings were constructed before 1940. Yet the structures we often label as “old” or “dangerous” rarely match the reality on the ground. In neighborhoods like Blissville, Maspeth, and East Williamsburg, what remains are not brownstones or walk-ups, but factories, depots, and warehouses, aged not just by time, but by decades of zoning shifts and development pressures.

        <div class="g-text">
            Color, the most immediate visual cue, quickly revealed regional characteristics across the city. Dense clusters of green often point to business districts dominated by glass façades. In contrast, areas shaded in purples tend to show neighborhoods that have undergone less gentrification: places where a more eclectic mix of materials, and therefore colors, signal older and less commercially homogenized (lots of glass/green) development.

            How About...

                applying NYC Building Materials to other cities?

            In theory, I'd do it in a heartbeat. In practice, it takes more work. Each city has its own logic: shaped by data availability, planning history, and the ways people have built over time.
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            First, there’s the data. To begin mapping a city’s material footprint, we need access to a comprehensive building dataset: basic details about each structure, from size to construction type. That’s the foundation.
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            Then comes the knowledge: the local context, architectural patterns, and historical shifts that give meaning to the data. In New York City, for example, more than 90% of buildings are three stories or fewer—a fact that shaped how I defined the building categories and subcategories. But in a city like Taipei, where five-story walkups dominate (often with added rooftop structures), a different system of classification is needed. 
        </div>
        <div class="g-text">
            But with today’s widespread use of GIS in government and city planning, this kind of data is more accessible than ever. That opens the door for scaling the project: adapting NYC Building Materials to other cities, each with its own patterns, materials, and histories. With the right data and local insight, this framework could travel borders.

                    NYC Building Materials uses a combination of open data from NYC Open Data, in this case, <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/content/planning/pages/resources/datasets/mappluto-pluto-change">MapPLUTO</a> for buliding properties like height, number of stories, and building type; and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03190-7">RASMI</a>, short for Regional Assessment of buildings’ Material Intensities, by Tomer Fisherman et al., for the material composition of buildings. These compositions include the building's structure, facade, and interior materials, but do not take furnitures and foundations/piles into account.

                <div class="g-heading-bio-text">
                    I then used Python's scikit-learn library to cluster (in this case, k-prototype for a mixture of data types) the buildings into six major categories and several subcategories based on their properties, and then applied the RASMI data (all median values) to each cluster to estimate the material composition of each building.
